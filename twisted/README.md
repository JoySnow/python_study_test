And I learned twisted programing from this guy: Dave Peticolas
    A series introduces of Twisted:
     http://krondo.com/an-introduction-to-asynchronous-programming-and-twisted/
    I had clone his sample codes
        to:
            python_study_test/twisted/twisted-intro
        from:
            git://github.com/jdavisp3/twisted-intro.git
    And I did some of his "Suggested Exercises" in it.
